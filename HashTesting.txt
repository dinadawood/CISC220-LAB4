You can add this method to your hashMap class – it prints out every hash node in your hash map.  Each node consists of key-value pairs.  The key is the word on the left, and the values are the words on the right (all representing words that followed the key in the Dickens text somewhere.  

If this helps, please feel free to use it:

Printing the hashMap (Note – your hashing functions may be different than mine.  So your words may be in a different order – remember that a hashMap implements the Set ADT, which has no order.  So I cannot tell you what order your nodes will be in your hash Map.  That said, these are the key-value pairs of my Dickens hashmap.  

Method:
void hashMap::printMap() {
	cout << "In printMap()" << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < mapSize; i++) {
		if (map[i] != NULL) {
			cout << map[i]->keyword << ": ";
			for (int j = 0; j < map[i]->currSize;j++) {
				cout << map[i]->values[j] << ", ";
			}
			cout << endl;
		}
